== is an operator. equals is a method defined in the Object class

== checks if two objects have the same address(refernce) in the memory for non-primitive datatypes
and for primitive it checks if they have the same value.


== compares the references while .equals() compares the attributes(i.e. the actual value)

equals method on the other hand checks if the two objects which are being compared have an actual
equal value(depending on how ofcourse the equals method has been implemented for the objects. 
equals method cannot be applied on primitives(which means that if a is a primitive a.equals(someobject) 
is not allowed, however someobject.equals(a) is allowed)



Example:

class Mycar
{
  string color;
  Mycar(string str)
 {
   color = str;
 }
}   

Mycar a = new Mycar("blue");
Mycar b = new Mycar("blue");
a==b // Returns false
a.Equals(b) // Returns true
